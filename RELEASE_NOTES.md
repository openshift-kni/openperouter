## Release v0.3.0

### New Features

- The underlay `interfaces` union supports a new `CNI` type: the controller provisions underlay interfaces in the router namespace by invoking a CNI plugin defined inline in the Underlay spec (`cniDevice.rawConfig`), with IPAM delegated to the plugin. The macvlan and static CNI plugins are bundled in the controller image. The non-functional `multusNetworkAnnotation` chart value and operator API field were removed. (#543, @qinqon)
- The controller now bundles CNI plugin binaries (macvlan, ipvlan, static, dhcp) and exposes a libcni-based invoker, preparing for direct underlay interface provisioning in the router netns without Multus. (#544, @maiqueb)
- Introduce route reflector support: some nodes can be instructed to have route reflector clients. This enables scenarios where the TOR can't be modified in order to propagate routes across the nodes. (#509, @qinqon)
- The controller now manages a DHCP daemon subprocess that handles lease acquisition and renewal for CNI-provisioned underlay interfaces, with automatic lease re-acquisition after controller restarts. (#596, @maiqueb)
- Support listenRange to configure neighbors. (#509, @qinqon)
- Enable Encaps.Red encapsulation for SRV6 overlays (#570, @andreaskaris)
- Introduce tool for inspecting OpenPERouter deployments for easier troubleshooting. (#484, @ormergi)
- L3VPN + L2VNI combinations now support l2gatewayIPs. (#562, @andreaskaris)
- Run systemd mode frr containers in a separate network namespace, like the k8s variant does. (#546, @fedepaol)
- TAP device based support for Grout / L3VNI (#635, @zeeke)
- The OpenPERouter now supports setups with both L3VPNs and L3VNIs across different VRFs. (#608, @andreaskaris)
- The controller now handles underlay NIC changes by swapping interfaces in-place instead of deleting and recreating the router pod and network namespace. (#547, @maiqueb)

### Bug fixes

- Calculate MTU correctly per VRF for mixed L3VPN + L2VNI deployments (both with and without encaps.red), L3VNI + L2VNI deployments, and all other possible combinations of L3 overlay resources. (#584, @andreaskaris)
- Bump DPDK/grout dataplane to v0.17.1, including the IPv6 NDP/RA flag fix. (#708, @RamLavi)
- Disable rp_filter sysctl on grout ports (#564, @zeeke)
- Do not add advertise-svi-ip in the generated frr configuration as it's not needed (ip and mac are the same at all nodes) and triggers crash on zebra. (#647, @qinqon)
- Fix DHCP lease cleanup on pod deletion by consuming the upstream ciaddr fix (containernetworking/plugins#1279). (#643, @maiqueb)
- Fix RouterID derivation to be consistent with loopback and other per-node address assignments by removing the +1 index offset. (#693, @andreaskaris)
- Fix reconcile storm caused by status being re-patched on every reconcile due to LastTransitionTime mismatch. (#542, @RamLavi)
- Fix route reflectors setting next-hop-self for route reflector clients in IPv4/IPv6 unicast and VPN address families, which caused the route reflector to be inserted into the data path. (#731, @andreaskaris)
- Fix: logLevel is ignored in controller container when specified in the nodeConfig when running in systemd mode (#674, @andreaskaris)
- Fix: session reset after configuration reload when default graceful restart timers are applied (#668, @fedepaol)
- Fixed CRI-O (e.g. OpenShift) deployments failing because the controller was missing the FRR reloader socket path. (#588, @maiqueb)
- Fixed a crash of the FRR bgpd daemon that could happen while VNIs were being created, by applying the FRR configuration before the corresponding kernel objects. (#630, @qinqon)
- Improve error wrapping in VNI and L3VPN cleanup functions (#573, @andreaskaris)
- CNI-provisioned underlay interfaces are now validated with a CNI CHECK
  on every reconcile. If an interface was removed or misconfigured
  outside of OpenPERouter, the next reconcile tears it down and
  re-provisions it instead of trusting a stale cache entry. (#614, @RamLavi)

### Breaking API Changes

- API: Neighbor.passwordSecret now references a Secret key via {name, key} instead of a bare secret name (key defaults to "password"). (#638, @RamLavi)
- API: OpenPERouter CRD:  `spec.tolerateMaster` and `spec.runOnMaster` replaced with Kubernetes native scheduling primitives `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`, `spec.affinity` now affect all OpenPERouter pods. (#649, @ormergi)
- API: Renamed enum values to PascalCase (External/Internal, LinuxBridge/OVSBridge, IPv4/IPv6/DualStack). This is a breaking change for v1alpha1 users who must update their CR manifests. (#593, @RamLavi)
- CRD field names in YAML/JSON are renamed from flat-lowercase to lowerCamelCase. Existing manifests must be updated. (#636, @maiqueb)
- The `autoCreate` field on `L2VNI` `hostmaster.linuxBridge` and `hostmaster.ovsBridge` has been replaced by a `lifecycle` enum. Replace `autoCreate: true` with `lifecycle: Managed`, and a bare `name: <bridge>` with `lifecycle: External` plus `name: <bridge>`. As before, a name may only be set for user provided (External) bridges; Managed bridges are named `br-hs-<VNI>`. (#626, @qinqon)
- The `ebgpMultiHop` field on `Underlay` `neighbors[]` has been replaced by a session level `properties` list. Replace `ebgpMultiHop: true` with a `properties` entry of `type: ebgpMultiHop`, which now also accepts an optional `ttl` (1-255, FRR defaults to 255). (#628, @qinqon)
- The `passiveMode` field on `Underlay` `neighbors[].bfd` has been replaced by a `sessionMode` enum: replace `passiveMode: true` with `sessionMode: Passive`. The `echoMode` and `echoInterval` fields have been removed; BFD echo mode only works between FRR instances and is inert against a physical fabric. (#627, @qinqon)
- HostSession `localCIDR.ipv4` / `localCIDR.ipv6` is replaced by `localCIDRs`, an ordered list of CIDRs (at most one IPv4 and one IPv6). action required (#735, @RamLavi)

## Release v0.2.0

### New Features
- Add AddressFamilies to Neighbor struct (#494, @andreaskaris)

  For underlay, this enables more flexible BGP peering scenarios where
  the exact remote ASN is unknown respectively it simplifies the L3VPN
  configuration.
  
  Potentially breaking API change due to removal of unused field Neighbor.HostASN. (#260, @andreaskaris)
- Add support for IPv6 and unnumbered BGP underlay sessions with ToR switches
  Complete rewrite of check_veths in golang (#286, @andreaskaris)

- Allow moving multiple nics in the OpenPERouter network namespace and allow setting multiple neighbors for the underlay. (#307, @fedepaol)
- Api: Introduce node router status API. 
  Enable inspecting router configuration status on a spesific node via NodeRouterConfigurationStatus CRD. (#355, @ormergi)
- Automatically set veth MTU to underlay NIC MTU minus 50 bytes to
  account for VXLan encapsulation overhead, preventing frame
  fragmentation at MTU boundaries. (#304, @qinqon)
- Bump base FRR version to 10.6.0 (#295, @zeeke)
- Bump to a newer version of containerlab for lab deployment and use new group topology element. (#274, @andreaskaris)

- Implementation of SRv6 / ISIS enhancement proposal (#485, @andreaskaris)
- Introduce per-resource configuration resilience.
  
  Invalid L3VNI resources cause their VRF to be skipped along with dependent L2VNIs.
  Invalid L2VNIs are isolated and do not affect other resources.
  VRF subnet overlaps are detected and all affected resources are skipped.
  FRR reload failures are reported as FrrConfigurationFailed with automatic retry.
  
  All failures are reported via RouterNodeConfigurationStatus with detailed conditions. (#423, @RamLavi)
- Make the router resilient to data plane crashes. (#317, @maiqueb)
- Mirror configuration consumed by static files to k8s resources for better visibility. (#469, @fedepaol)
- The controller now bundles CNI plugin binaries (macvlan, ipvlan, static, dhcp) and exposes a libcni-based invoker, preparing for direct underlay interface provisioning in the router netns without Multus. (#544, @maiqueb)

### Bug fixes
- Add liveness probe to FRR container to restart the pod when FRR daemons crash and cannot be recovered by watchfrr. (#455, @andreaskaris)
- Bridge refresher: don't ping ipv6 lla neighbros, listen for neighbor events instead of polling for stale entries (#312, @fedepaol)
- Correct the router component default container name (#319, @maiqueb)
- Don't fail when only rawConfig is provided. (#311, @fedepaol)
- Fix VRF route import failures caused by namespace loopback (lo) being down. The VTEP IP is now assigned directly to lo instead of a separate lound dummy interface. (#467, @andreaskaris)
- Fix start race condition where k8s api is available already, the static controller dies but the health port is not free yet, causing the k8sapicontroller to die because the port is not ready. (#325, @fedepaol)
- Fix underlay interface not being moved back to the default network namespace on underlay deletion. The interface is now restored with its original IP addresses and link-up state. (#442, @andreaskaris)
- Fix vulnerability GO-2026-5026 (#460, @andreaskaris)
- Fix: add unreachable routes to prevent VRF escape (#242, @fdomain)
- In order to be able to deploy the lab on aarch64,
  dynamically set the image architecture in common.sh. (#515, @andreaskaris)
- Monitor the frr container in systemd mode, if it restarts we reconfigure it. (#479, @fedepaol)
- Reject l2gatewayip on disconnected L2VNI (#332, @RamLavi)
- Validate static configuration files with CEL rules and apply defaults. (#310, @fedepaol)

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
- API types updated to comply with Kubernetes API conventions via kube-api-linter. Breaking changes: integer fields use int32/int64 instead of uint, duration fields replaced with seconds integers, optional fields use pointers. (#313, @qinqon)
- API: Rename `EVPNConfig` to `TunnelEndpointConfig` in the Underlay CRD to better reflect its purpose and in preparation for SRv6 implementation. (#471, @andreaskaris)

- Cleanup of iBGP E2E test (#404, @andreaskaris)
- Collect more logs on E2E failure (#308, @andreaskaris)
- Do not set AddrGenModeNone on L2 VNI bridges. (#351, @maiqueb)
- Fix duplicate address-family blocks in FRR passthrough configuration by removing unused neighborenableipfamily template calls. Remove IPFamily from frr_test.go for l3vni and passthrough input as it is never set by production code. (#474, @andreaskaris)
- Fix flake in RawFRRConfig E2E test "should order multiple raw config snippets by priority" (#403, @andreaskaris)
- Fix generation of operator/config/webhook/webhook/manifests.yaml (#393, @andreaskaris)

- Improve logging in testFileIsValid when FRR tests fail (#480, @andreaskaris)
- Minor cleanup of L3Passthrough E2E test (#318, @andreaskaris)
- Pre-delete all interfaces in the router netns as part of the recovery procedure. This will greatly reduce the time it take the kernel to async delete the network namespace via `cleanup_net()` (#463, @maiqueb)
- Remove unused file clab/spine/daemons (#301, @andreaskaris)
- Remove vtepInterface field from EVPNConfig. vtepCIDR is now the only (required) way to configure the VTEP source. (#461, @qinqon)
- Run go fmt in github CI (#429, @andreaskaris)
- Switch FRR logging from file to stdout, simplifying the container entrypoint and enabling native kubectl logs support. (#330, @qinqon)
- The Underlay `spec.nics` field is replaced by `spec.interfaces`, a discriminated union. Use `interfaces: [{type: NetworkDevice, networkDevice: {interfaceName: <nic>}}]` instead of `nics: [<nic>]`. action required (#517, @qinqon)
- This change adds BGP summary and ip address info to debug dump in case of failed tests.
  It also uses current spec report full text to identify multiple failing tests more easily and to avoid overwriting existing tests. (#293, @andreaskaris)
- Tweak the ConnectTime of the FRR K8s side to 1 second in E2E tests. (#294, @andreaskaris)

## Release v0.1.0

### New Features
- Add NodeSelector field to Underlay, L2VNI, L3VNI and L3Passthrough. (#164, @qinqon)
- Add support for the `ovs-bridge` hostmaster type. (#108, @maiqueb)
- Add vtepInterface field to EVPNConfig to allow using an existing interface as VTEP source instead of creating a loopback from vtepCIDR (#214, @qinqon)
- Added a non supported - experimentation only way to inject custom frr configuration. This can be used both to quickly workaround issues and to prototype new features. (#247, @fedepaol)
- Adds probes to the controller, nodemarker, and router components. (#149, @maiqueb)
- Api: refactor L2VNI HostMaster to enable different configurations per bridge type (#176, @maiqueb)
- Be more memory efficient, by only caching the required data for the controller operation (#200, @maiqueb)
- Compatibility with OpenShift clusters (#168, @zeeke)
- Fix SELinux volume write permission on router pods (#269, @zeeke)
- Handle changes in the static configuration files when running in host mode. (#226, @fedepaol)
- Have a way to consume a file based static configuration when running in systemd mode. This is useful to setup the basic connectivity required to the cluster to come up. Additional configuration created via the k8s api will be merged with the static configuration, allowing the creation of secondary network at day 2. (#201, @fedepaol)
- Provide a mechanism to run OpenPERouter on the host as systemd unit via podman. (#158, @fedepaol)
- Support dual stack for l2gatewayips field (#137, @qinqon)

### Bug fixes
- Api: rename l2vni hostmaster type from bridge to linux-bridge (#175, @maiqueb)
- Bump go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk to 1.40 to address GO-2026-4394 (#241, @maiqueb)
- Cleanup unamanged ovs bridge veths (#239, @maiqueb)
- Enable the `accept_untracked_na` sysctl in the router network namespaces, to learn MAC mobility events from unsolicited NA messages. (#207, @maiqueb)
- Enable the arp_accept sysctl in the router network namespaces, to learn MAC mobility events from GARPs. (#202, @maiqueb)
- Fix VNI resource cleanup when underlay is deleted along with VNIs (#238, @maiqueb)
- Fix controller container being killed by health check in systemd/host mode when transitioning to K8s API reconciler. (#249, @qinqon)
- Fix ovs missing row errors by using generated code from ovs schema. (#237, @qinqon)
- Fix the metallb example not starting for wrong common.sh path. (#208, @fedepaol)
- Generate linux bridge and ovs bridge manifests with CEL expressions (#219, @qinqon)
- Handle STALE neighbor entries by pinging the corresponding IPs. This still refreshes silent neighbors while forcing really STALE entries to get garbage collected. (#275, @fedepaol)
- Idle workloads become unreachable due to EVPN Type-2 route withdrawal when neighbor entries expire; proactively keep neighbor entries alive via periodic ARP probes. (#211, @maiqueb)
- Only set the L2VNI bridge MAC address when needed, thus preventing type 2 route withdrawal, in turn causing N/S traffic to break permanently (#232, @maiqueb)
- Support L3VNI on CRI-O by enabling always ipv4 ip forwarding (#212, @qinqon)
- Sysctl: accept_untracked_na is now skipped with a warning on kernels < 5.18 instead of blocking host configuration. (#231, @qinqon)
- Update Go from 1.24.0 to 1.24.9 and refresh dependency tree to resolve security vulnerabilities (#166, @qinqon)
- It is now possible to attach multiple L2VNIs to the same IP-VRF for as long as their subnets do not overlap with the L3VNI and other L2VNIs in the same VRF. (#265, @andreaskaris)

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
- Delete all unused bridges in a single OVSDB transaction. Do not dettach ports of managed bridges before deletion. (#240, @maiqueb)
- Log non recoverable errors in underlay reconciler (#270, @zeeke)
- Modernize golang code. (#268, @qinqon)

## Release v0.0.5

- Fix: allow omitting underlay NIC configuration when using Multus. (#155, @fdomain)
- Re-introduce the "redistribute-connected-from-default" flag when generating FRR configurations for the KinD leaves (#151, @maiqueb)

## Release v0.0.4

### New Features
- Add a multi-cluster demo setup (#126, @maiqueb)
- Allow pods to run on master nodes or not. (#122, @fedepaol)
- Allow the creation of a "passthrough" veth where the traffic is not being encapsulated but just re-routed by the router.
  This might come handy for those scenarios where we want the host to reach the "flat" network without having to establish an additional bgp session. (#117, @fedepaol)
- Api: make L3VNI VRF field mandatory (#135, @qinqon)
- Enforce the session with the host / with the TOR to be ebgp. (#95, @fedepaol)
- Optional hostsession in the L3VNI CRD, now it's not mandatory to setup a session if a l3vni serves as L3 wrapper of a L2 VNI. (#102, @fedepaol)

### Bug fixes
- Fix cr based validation of the nic name in the underlay crd. (#130, @fedepaol)
- Make gateway ip and local cidrs immutable. (#94, @fedepaol)
